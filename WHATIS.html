        <h1>Understanding BMI (Body Mass Index)</h1>
        <p>Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on your weight in relation to your height. It provides a general indication of whether you're underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.</p>
        
        <h2>Why is BMI Important?</h2>
        <p>BMI is important because it helps assess your risk of certain health conditions associated with being underweight, overweight, or obese, such as heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension. Maintaining a healthy BMI is crucial for overall well-being and longevity.</p>
        
        <h2>BMI Ranges</h2>
        <p>BMI is categorized into the following ranges:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Underweight: BMI less than 18.5</li>
            <li>Normal weight: BMI 18.5–24.9</li>
            <li>Overweight: BMI 25–29.9</li>
            <li>Obese: BMI 30 or higher</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>How is BMI Calculated?</h2>
        <p>BMI is calculated by dividing your weight in kilograms by the square of your height in meters:</p>
        <p>BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m))<sup>2</sup></p>
        
        <h2>How BMI Affects a Person</h2>
        <p>BMI can affect a person's health in various ways. Being underweight or overweight can increase the risk of developing health problems such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and musculoskeletal disorders. Maintaining a healthy BMI contributes to better overall health and quality of life.</p>
        
        <h2>Why is it Important to Maintain a Good BMI?</h2>
        <p>Maintaining a good BMI is important for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Promoting overall health and well-being</li>
            <li>Reducing the risk of chronic diseases</li>
            <li>Improving physical fitness and mobility</li>
            <li>Enhancing self-esteem and body image</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Important Note</h2>
        <p>While BMI is a useful tool for assessing general health risks associated with weight, it is not the only and most accurate indication of a person's health. Other factors such as muscle mass, bone density, and distribution of fat also play a significant role in determining overall health. It's essential to focus on overall lifestyle habits, including balanced nutrition, regular physical activity, and stress management, for optimal health and well-being.</p>
        
        <h1>Understanding BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)</h1>
        <p>BMR is the number of calories your body needs to perform basic, life-sustaining functions such as breathing, circulation, and cell production while at rest.</p>
        
        <h2>Why is BMR Important?</h2>
        <p>Knowing your BMR can help you understand how many calories you need to maintain, lose, or gain weight. It forms the basis for calculating your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE).</p>
        
        <h2>How is BMR Calculated?</h2>
        <p>BMR can be estimated using the following equations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For men: BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 * weight in kg) + (4.799 * height in cm) - (5.677 * age in years)</li>
            <li>For women: BMR = 447.593 + (9.247 * weight in kg) + (3.098 * height in cm) - (4.330 * age in years)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>How BMR Affects a Person</h2>
        <p>Your BMR is a significant part of your overall metabolism and energy expenditure. Understanding your BMR helps you to manage your caloric intake effectively.</p>
        
        <h1>Understanding TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)</h1>
        <p>TDEE is the total number of calories your body needs in a day, taking into account all activities, from resting to physical exercise.</p>
        
        <h2>Why is TDEE Important?</h2>
        <p>Knowing your TDEE helps you understand how many calories you need to consume to maintain your current weight. Adjusting your caloric intake based on your TDEE can help you lose or gain weight.</p>
        
        <h2>How is TDEE Calculated?</h2>
        <p>TDEE is calculated by multiplying your BMR by an activity factor based on your lifestyle:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sedentary (little or no exercise): TDEE = BMR * 1.2</li>
            <li>Lightly active (light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week): TDEE = BMR * 1.375</li>
            <li>Moderately active (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week): TDEE = BMR * 1.55</li>
            <li>Very active (hard exercise/sports 6-7 days a week): TDEE = BMR * 1.725</li>
            <li>Super active (very hard exercise/physical job): TDEE = BMR * 1.9</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>How TDEE Affects a Person</h2>
        <p>Understanding your TDEE allows you to manage your weight more effectively by aligning your caloric intake with your energy expenditure.</p>
